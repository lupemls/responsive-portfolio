# responsive-portfolio
This is a remake of the portfolio website using bootstrap to make it more responsive. Content will take up the full width of the screen on xs screens, and have margins on anything larger than that. It will contain the bootstrap navbar with collapsing and expanding elements. It also has responsive images that will shrink as the screen gets smaller.
